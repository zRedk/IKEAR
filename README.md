## Purpose

IKEAR was born out of a desire to learn and master various iOS development techniques and technologies. Through this project, I aimed to gain proficiency in ARKit, RealityKit, QuickLook, and dynamic currency conversion while replicating the UI/UX of the original IKEA app. By creating custom tab views and enhancing accessibility features, IKEAR serves not only as a practical tool for users but also as a testament to my growth as an iOS developer. Whether you're looking to explore AR integration, UI/UX design, or accessibility features, IKEAR offers valuable insights and hands-on experience in creating innovative mobile applications.
